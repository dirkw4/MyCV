                <h3>I am a Management Information Systems Specialist & Laboratory Operations Process Systems Designer.</h3>
                <p>I am an energetic, hardworking, ambitious and reliable person who has developed a mature and 
                   responsible approach to any task that I undertake, or situation that I am presented with. I am 
                   excellent in working with others but also independently to achieve a certain objective on time 
                   and with excellence. My whole life I have been a late bloomer and I am mostly like a fine wine that ages well with time and performs better as I get older.
                   I will probably never be a developer of Silicon Valley standards, but I have a nick and passion for technology and to build things.
                   My perseverance is what mostly helps me make it to the end to get things right.
                   We are now living a digital age and with the AI on the rise we have to equip ourselves to be tech savvy to survive in this age.
                   My dream is to be able to go anywhere in the world and be able to work remotely.
                   My ultimate dream is to be able to work for myself. The fact that my ship to be a professional golfer sailed long ago, I think the next best dream would be to have my own wine farm with its own cellar and a fancy hotel on it to host events and functions.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   I am a huge golf fanatic. I love playing and watching the sport since I was a small boy. I also like a bit of Formula 1 motorsport and grandslam tennis tournaments.
                   I am an avid book worm and love to lose myself into fantacy-fiction books. 
                   I cannot close my eyes at night if I didn't ready a little bit. I will go completely crazy if a day passed and I skipped a reading session.

                        <h2>Superintendent Calibration & Verification - Relieving</h2>
                        <h3>Assmang Limited Khumani | 2019 - 2021</h3>
                        <p id="experience-text-summary">During the COVID-19 epidemic I was tasked to relieve as the Superintendent of a Calibration Laboratory.
                                                        Here I managed a large group of people and were also responsible for the calibration and verification of all the analytical instruments in the laboratory.
                                                        I was also responsible for the calibration of the online analysis equipment that is stationed in the production plant providing instantaneous realtime results to the plant operators.
                                                        With this exposure I gained a lot of new knowledge and quite enjoyed this relieving opportunity.
                                                        In order to manage the accuracy of the online analytical equipment better, I have built myself automated dashboards that uses SQL queries embedded in excel to extract the product data and dumps it into static tables in excel.
                                                        From there I made automated pivot tables that will display the equipment performances for me.

                        <h2>Product Quality Management Information Systems Specialist</h2>
                        <h3>Assmang Limited Khumani | 2016 - Current</h3>
                        <p id="experience-text-summary">After three years of relieving as Management Information Systems (MIS) for Product Quality I was appointed to fulltime MIS Specialist for the Product Quality department.
                                                        My core function as MIS Specialist is to of manage the Laboratory LIMS. Secondary to that is coordinating between the laboratory core staff to get the end-user specifications on how the laboratory want the LIMS to fuction.
                                                        Planning and executing system configurations and enhancements by compiling software specifications for the LIMS system developers. 
                                                        Testing and commissioning of newly deployed system config. Here I started to learn about MSSQL and DBA functions. 
                                                        I'm still quite a relative light-weight with MSSQL, but I know enough now to navigate my way around and extract the required data to do what I need.
                                                        I'm quite sharp and proficient with Excel dashboard builing and hooking up tables to a database to extract data from the DB.
                                                        I have learned a lot about OLAP Cubes and Power BI that enhanced my skills and knowledge about dashboards even further.
                                                        Late 2023 I reached a turning point when a developer colleague and friend suddenly passed away and that pushed me in a focused direction to start and learn about computer and software development.
                                                        This is when I came across the immersive fullstack development bootcamp offered by HyperionDev and decided to enroll.
